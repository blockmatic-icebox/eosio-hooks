# EOSIO Hooks

EOSIO hooks library for the new React Era.

React Hooks is the new way of writing ReactJS applications. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class, which means you can now write your entire application using funcitonal programming and functional components and this has a myriad of advantages. Most notably having the ability to separate functionality by concern and not by stage in the lifecycle method ( single responsibility principle ) which makes the source code of the applications much more readable, maintainable and increases reusability of the components.

Read [ReactJS Hooks Motivation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation) for more information.

On [blockmatic/react-dapp-stack](https://github.com/blockmatic/react-dapp-stack) you will find a collection of guidelines, tools, talks and packages for building ReactJS EOSIO dApps using Functional JavaScript with TypeScript.
