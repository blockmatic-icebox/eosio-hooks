# EOSIO Hooks

EOSIO hooks library for the new React Era.

_THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROCESS_

## Motivation

React Hooks is the new way of writing ReactJS applications. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class, which means you can now write your entire application using funcitonal programming and functional components and this has a myriad of advantages. Most notably having the ability to separate functionality by concern and not by stage in the lifecycle method ( single responsibility principle ) which makes the source code of the applications much more readable, maintainable and increases reusability of the components.

Read [ReactJS Hooks Motivation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation) for more information.

## Usage

`yarn bootstrap && yarn build && cd example && yarn start`

## Commons Issues

Duplicated React versions in your project. Run `yarn why react` to detect them.
